# E-commerce Forecasting: ML-Driven Merchant Trends

## Project Description

This project focuses on leveraging machine learning techniques to forecast merchant trends in the e-commerce sector. By analyzing historical sales data, we aim to predict future sales trends, enabling businesses to make data-driven decisions. The project involves data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation, followed by forecasting and visualization of the results. The primary goal is to provide a comprehensive solution for trend analysis and forecasting in e-commerce using advanced machine learning algorithms.
